# Ransomware
I wanted to see how easy it is to create ransomware,

The program was created in Python and is targeted for Windows users. 

Running the executeable will first contact a C&C server to get an encryption key, it will then encrypt all the users files before deleting itself and opening a webpage asking the user to send some Bitcoins to get their files back.

The current build was created in about an hour and works okay. I would like to add lots more features when I have some free time.
